    <h2> Description </h2>
    
    <p> It may take some effort to peel pomelo, but
         I love the mildly sweet flesh. It's so much better 
        than grapefruit, in my opinion! I was inspired to try 
        it in a Thai-style salad that was a 
        little sweet and a little sour 
        with hints of spice and funk. Enjoy!
    </p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>

    <ul>
    <li> 2 tsp unsweetened coconut flakes</li>
    <li> 1 pomelo </li> 
    <li> 2 tsp fried shallots </li> 
    <li> and more!! </li> 
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>

    <ol> 
    <li> Cook and stir coconut in a dry skillet over medium-low heat until toasted and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>

    <li> Cut top and bottom off the pomelo, about 1/2 inch from each side. Make vertical cuts around the fruit, about 1/2 inch into the rind. Pull off slices of rind. Pull off any thick pieces of membrane. Split fruit open and separate into segments. Peel membrane off each slice. </li>

    <li>  Place pomelo slices in a shallow bowl. Sprinkle toasted coconut, peanuts, shallots, and mint on top. </li>

    <li> Combine hot water and palm sugar in a jar. Stir until sugar dissolves. Whisk in lime juice, fish sauce, and chile pepper. Spoon dressing over salad. </li>
    </ol>
